## 🧠 Project Overview

This project was developed as part of my **summer internship** and focuses on leveraging the power of **AI and machine learning** to address the growing threat of phishing attacks online. It aims to provide a real-time solution that can automatically classify URLs as either **legitimate** or **phishing**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Detect and classify phishing websites using machine learning
- Provide an easy-to-use web interface for URL checking
- Integrate cybersecurity concepts with AI for threat detection
- Create a lightweight, deployable solution using Flask and Python

---

## 📊 Dataset & Model

- 📁 Dataset: Custom dataset with **500 rows** and **2 key features**
- 🌲 Model: **Random Forest Classifier** for robust and accurate classification
- ⚙️ Performance: Evaluated on ability to distinguish phishing vs. legitimate URLs

---

## 🌐 Web Application (Flask)

- 🧩 **Flask-based web app** for real-time interaction
- 🖥️ Users input a URL through the web interface
- ⚙️ Backend handles:
  - Data preprocessing
  - Model prediction
  - Result display (Phishing or Legitimate)
